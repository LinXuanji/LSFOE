# LSFOE
**Overlapping ellipse fitting based on least square method written in c++**

LSFOE is an ellipse fitting back-end system based on least squares written in C ++. The system supports positioning of overlapping elliptical targets based on binocular vision (especially small tomatoes), and provides a set of inverse solution algorithms for posture from the starting point to the target point of the 6-degree-of-freedom manipulator.
